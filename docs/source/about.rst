**pyPhase** is an open source phase retrieval package created by *Max Langer*. X-ray propagation-based imaging techniques are well-established at synchrotron radiation and laboratory sources. However, most reconstruction algorithms for such image modalities, also known as phase retrieval algorithms, have been developed specifically for one instrument by and for experts, making the development and spreading of the use of such techniques difficult. Here, we present PyPhase, a free and open-source package for propagation-based near-field phase reconstructions, which is distributed under the CeCILL license. PyPhase implements some of the most popular phase-retrieval algorithms in a highly-modular framework supporting the deployment on large-scale computing facilities. This makes the integration, the development of new phase-retrieval algorithms, and the deployment on different computing infrastructures straight-forward. To demonstrate its capabilities and simplicity, we present its application to data acquired at synchrotron MAX~IV (Lund, Sweden).
